# Customer Segmentation Analysis using unsupervised learning in Retail Sectors
In this project, we will analyze a dataset containing data on various customers’ annual spending amounts (reported in monetary units) of diverse product categories for internal structure. One goal of this project is to best describe the variation in the different types of customers that a wholesale distributor interacts with. Doing so would equip the distributor with insight into how to best structure their delivery service to meet the needs of each customer.
The dataset for this project saved by the name Wholesale Customer data on this  Repository. For the purposes of this project, the features 'Channel' and 'Region' will be excluded in the analysis — with focus instead on the six product categories recorded for customers.
Applied skills: Python, Scikit-learn, PCA, Clustering
